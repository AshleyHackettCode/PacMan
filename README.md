# PacMan

This is a fun little Pac Man project that showcases my expanding knowledge. 
Enjoy!

Description

Pac-Man starts to move from left to right with interchanging images.

Once it reaches the right most edge of the screen it changes its direction.

How to run

There are no dependencies. This should run inside the browser without the need for a proxy server

Roadmap of future improvements

Pieces of candies could be randomly placed on the map for Pacmen to eat.
